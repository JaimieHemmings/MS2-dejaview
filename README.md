DejaView is an interactive website developed to help users find new movies to enjoy based on varying criteria, whether it be recommendations based on user supplied criteria, existing reviews or randomly generated recommendations based on nothing but luck.

## Overview

DejaView intends to be the number one resource for finding movie recommendations or finding information about movies in general.

## <a name="UX"></a>User Experience (UX)

### Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time visitor I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website
- As a first time visitor I want to be able to immediately understand how to navigate and use the website.
- As a first time visitor I expect the website to display appropriately regardless of the screen size I view it on
- As a first time visitor I want to easily ube able understand how to use the main features of the website

### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor, I want to see a varied selection of recommended movies
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to browse for movie recommendations with the use of a filter for things like release date or genre

### Frequent Visitor Goals

- As a frequent visitor I want to be able to easily find information about a specific movie
- As a frequent visitor I want to be able to easily navigate to a specific part of the website
- As a frequent visitor I want to be able to easily provide feedback to the site owner

### Colour Scheme

In order to make the page as bright, inviting and user friendly as possible, I will be implementing a range of bright, friendly colours while keeping text as readable as possibly by using white text on a faded black background, or white text on a faded black background.

The primary colours used will be `#ff901f`, `#f222ff` and `#8c1eff`. I will be using the "Retrowave" theme throughout the website in order to pay homage to the 80's. A decade that I, personally, feel was the prime time for movies.

### Typography

In keeping with the 80's theme, I will be using "Audiowide" as the primary font and "Space Mono" for the secondary font of the website. I feel these two fonts will allow me to keep a coherent and fitting theme throughout the website while allowing for optimal readability and careful usage of font weights will allow me to direct the user to key sections of the website.

### Imagery

The imagery of the website will feature a lot of cover art relevant to the movie for which information is being displayed.

## Features

DejaView will feature a large search area on the homepage, allowing the user to immediately start searching by a number of filters to find either a specific movie or movie recommendations based on their filter inputs.

The website will also feature a list of recently released movies allowing the user the peruse the relevant information for that movie and then view a selection of other movies based attributes for that movie, like genre.

The user will then also be provided with a url to visit the dedicated website for that movie if they wish to find additional information.
